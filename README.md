# Project Title: Implementation and Analysis of Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) in Network Redundancy
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)â€”a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol used to ensure high availability and fault tolerance in IP networks. HSRP enables automatic failover of the default gateway in case of router failure, minimizing network downtime and maintaining seamless connectivity for end users.
# Objectives
- To understand the working principles of HSRP and its role in network resilience.
- To configure HSRP on Cisco routers and simulate failover scenarios.
- To analyze the performance and reliability improvements offered by HSRP.
# Scope of Work
- Design a network topology with 2 routers and hosts.
- Configure HSRP groups with active and standby routers.
- Test failover behavior by simulating router outages.
- Monitor network traffic and gateway transitions during failover.
# Tools and Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS (for router configuration)
# Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional HSRP-enabled network with seamless gateway failover.
- Performance analysis reports showing reduced downtime and improved reliability.
- Comparative insights into HSRP vs. other redundancy protocols.
- Configuration templates and troubleshooting guidelines.
# Deliverables
- Project report with diagrams, configurations, and analysis
- Simulation files and configuration scripts
